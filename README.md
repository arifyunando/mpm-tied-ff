# Tied Free Field Boundary Implementation on The Material Point Method

This repository contains all the code materials for the Master Thesis of 
Civil Engineering (Geotechnical Engineering) at TU Delft, The Netherlands.

## Getting Started

The main thesis code are all organized to a Visual Studio 2022 solution file.

To run the code:
1. Open the solution with Visual Studio 2022
2. Make sure that OneAPI Intel Fortran Compiler and OneAPI MKL Library is installed in your computer
3. Select a startup project
4. Run the code
